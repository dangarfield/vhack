Money/cash and NetCoins. To make money, Tap on &quot;Console&quot; and select any one of the 9 targets (representing other players), then tap &quot;Tr.Transfer&quot; You will get 40% of your target&#39;s money on a successful hack (36% of your target&#39;s money if you&#39;re in a cluster and rest of the 4% of the target&#39;s money goes to your cluster&#39;s cluster bank which is an unimplemented feature, for now). In case it says that your hack wasn&#39;t successful, go to &quot;Upgrades&quot; on your main screen and upgrade SDK. Upgrades cost money and take time. The time left, can be seen in &quot;Tasks&quot;.</p>\n<p>There are 2 kinds of Money/Cash. One of which can be hacked by other players via Trojen transfers whereas the other cannot be hacked in that way. Safe/Unhackable money stays with you until it is spent. There is no way to differentiate hackable from safe cash, short of having a friend scan you, since safe money does not appear when scanned. Ex: If you have $500.000 hackable cash and $100.000.000, someone scanning you will see your money to be $500.000 whereas you will see it to be $100.500.000. Safe/Unhackable cash can be optained from packages, giveaways, events, and from the store by pating real money. Unhackable/safe money is used up before hackable money to prevent hoarding.</p>\n\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>HARDWARE</font></h3>\n\n\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Internet & CPU reduce upgrade times.<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Upgrade RAM to run more tasks.<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Upgrade HDD to install more updates<br>\n\n<p>Internet, CPU, RAM, and HDD all have easily achievable MAX values which are as follows.</p>\n\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Internet at 1.5Gbits<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>CPU at 2.8 GHz Hexacore<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>RAM at 32GB DDR3 1066MHz<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>HDD at 16TB.<br><br>\n\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>CONSOLE</font></h3>\n\n<p>The console is where the hacking happens. All the players you see in the console are around your score (specifically, x-/+3000, where x is your score). If, however, the &quot;Global&quot; checkbox is checked, your search will not be limited by your score and anyone may appear on the console. Your score can be checked by tapping the big trophy on the main page, labeled as &quot;Rankings&quot;.</p>\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>SOFTWARE</font></h3>\n\n<p>The software department is where you need to keep improving in order to stay ahead of curve and maintain and even improve your rank. each level of a certain software upgrade increases your score by a small amount which is as follows</p>\n\n\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>SDK = +5<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Spam = +5<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>AdWare = +4<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Firewall = +3<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Antivirus = +3<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>IP Spoofer = +3<br>\n<font color=#7ca9b9>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\u2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Scan = +3<br>\n\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>FIREWALL</font></h4>\n\n\n<p>Firewall is your first line of defence. A higher Firewall prevents players with high Scan from seeing your name and stats when they scan you. If you get attacked and your Firewall is higher than your attacker&#39;s IP Spoofer, you will be able to see their IP in your &quot;Log&quot;</p>\n\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>ANTIVIRUS</font></h4>\n\n<p>AntiVirus is your secondary defence. It isn&#39;t as important, but each level of AntiVirus, blocks a higher level of an attackers SDK, thus preventing them from taking money from you. As it stands, SDK is more powerful than AntiVirus, rendering AntiVirus almost useless until it reaches a very high level.</p>\n<p>AntiVirus is also responsible for keeping out AdWare and the removal of AdWare once infected. More on that in the AdWare section.</p>\n\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>SDK</font></h4>\n\n\n<p>The higher your SDK, the higher AvtiViruses you can Transfer Trojans through. This is the most important stat in the game. Currently, transferring Trojans is the main source of income for most players.</p>\n\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>IP-SPOOFING</font></h4>\n\n<p>Given that your IP Spoofing is higher than your target&#39;s Firewall, they will not be able to see your IP in their &quot;Log&quot;</p>\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>SCAN</font></h4>\n\n\n<p>Scan/Scanner enables you to see your target&#39;s stats and name allowing you to make the decision of whether or not you want to hack them. An &quot;Anonymous: YES|NO&quot; tells your whether you will leave your IP in their &quot;Log&quot; (dictated by you IP Spoofer and their Firewall). Your Scanner needs to be 1.5x your target&#39;s Firewall to be able to see their name. The rest of the calculations are largely unknown. In case you run a cluster, you will see a warning notifying you that the person you scanned is in your cluster.</p>\n\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>SPAM</font></h4>\n\n<p>The higher your Spam, the more money you get. It CREATES money, hence adding more money to the entire system. Your Spam Level * 500 is the money you get from Spam every hour.</p>\n\n<h4><font color=#7ca9b9>ADWARE</font></h4>\n\n<p>AdWare can be put on targets. Adware of higher level will allow you to put it on targets with higher level AntiVirus. AdWare also, like Spam, CREATES money, thus adding more money to the system. It does NOT reduce money from the person infected. The amount of money you get each hour is equivalent to 10% of the infected person&#39;s hourly Spam income.</p>\n<p>You can infect a maximum of 100 players with AdWare. In order to infect someone with AdWare, your AdWare level must be higher than 50% of your target&#39;s Antivirus level.</p>\n<p>Some players may also have &quot;Too much AdWare&quot;. If that is the case, no more can be put on them. You can remove or check AdWare on you as well as the AdWare you&#39;ve put on players by tapping &quot;Active AdWare&quot;. Keep in mind that you may be affected with adware and not be aware of it. &quot;Your System <strong>seems</strong> to be clean,&quot; however, it may not be. In this case upgrade your Antivirus.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that even if it says your system SEEMS to be clean, you may still have AdWare that you cannot see or remove, this can be remedied by increasing your AntiVirus. However, as it stands, being infected with AdWare brings no disadvantage to you as it does NOT reduce your Spam income or your banked money.</p>\n<p>Money obtained from placing AdWare on other players is safe/unhackable i.e it cannot be hacked by other players via Trojen transfers.</p>\n\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>NETCOINS</font></h3>\n\n<p>NetCoins are a premium currency that can be used to either skip upgrade timers or can be used to buy Packages. Efficiently using them depends on how long your upgrades take and the score points it nets you.</p>\n\n<p>They can be obtained from attacking BotNet targets, Events, Giveaways, or be bought from the shop for real money. </p>\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>BOTNET PCs</font></h3>\n\n<p>BotNets allow you to get premium currency called NetCoins. Attacking targets gives you a certain number of NetCoins and can be attacked after a certain interval of time has passed since you last did. Currently, only the &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Medium&quot; targets are available.</p>\n<p>The &quot;Easy&quot; target requires a total BotNet strength of at least 8%. Interval is 4 hrs</p>\n<p>The &quot;Medium&quot; target requires a total BotNet strength of at least 28%. Interval is 7 hrs</p>\n<p>BotNets can be upgraded using Money/Cash. More BotNets can be obtained using Packages. The maximum number of PCs one can have is 50 and the maximum level a PC can be on is 100. Is takes a total of $25.000.000.000 to level all 50 BotNet PCs up to 100.</p>\n\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>PACKAGES</font></h3>\n\n<p>Packages can be obtained by buying them with NetCoins, events, and giveaways on the vHack XT Facebook page</a>. You also get 1 Package every 24 hrs for logging in. Packages, when opened, have a chance of giving you safe/unhackable money, software, NetCoins or BotNets (given that you don&#39;t already have 50)</p></li>\n\n<h3><font color=#7ca9b9>CLUSTERS</font></h3>\n\n<p>A cluster is a group which can accommodate a maximum of 10 hackers. It has its own chat where IPs and tips can be exchanged. This provides a secondary goal to get your cluster higher on the leaderboard. </p>\n<p>When it comes to clusters you have two option- either make or join one. Making a cluster requires $800.000 (which is easy to come by). Most find it better to join a cluster as it allows them to get guidance from already experienced members and utilize resources already established long before they joined, such as IP databases etc. Some choose not to join any cluster, because as it stands, clusters provide no in-game benefits. Most of the features associated with clusters are unimplemented (cluster banks, cluster wars etc.), but are to come in future updates.</p>\n<p>When in a cluster, 10% of all the money you get from transferring trojans to other players will be put in your &quot;Cluster Bank&quot;. This means you will only get 36% of your target&#39;s money as opposed to the 40% you get while not in any cluster. <em>(as per the mechanics of the game, the target also only loses 36% of their money and the equivalent of the 10% they would lose is generated and put in the Cluster Bank. However, this may change when Cluster Banks actually have a use)</em>. Many see this as a disadvantage and choose not to join clusters. However, money is actually pretty easy to come by and being in a cluster enhances this game&#39;s core aspects...that of community.</p>\n<p>The most common way to look for a suitable cluster is to ask on General/Public Chat. Be sure to tell your raw score (NOT overall score and NOT reputation), since most clusters recruit players based on score.</p>\n<p>Clusters have their own chats where IPs can be exchanged. However, General Chat does NOT allow this. More on that, later.</p>\n\n<p>-vHack XT Team</p>\n<p>written by: Dr.K1NG</p>\n\n"));
